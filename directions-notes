Tour Some Sugar On Me
You have been hired by Samantha Ducarte, a tour promoter, to build a website that allows her to see the venues that she manages, a list of all bands that will be performing for the next 6 months, and a list of all bookings.

Learning Objectives
Analytical Thinking: Understand requirements and data before development
Communication: Ask questions to clarify any vague or conflicting requirements
CSS: Using Flexbox to position elements on the web page
Events: Implementing event listeners to respond to the user clicking on DOM elements
Data: Understanding data relationship, and using for..of loops to find related data in a database
Venues
Each venue can accomodate 2 bands per night as Samantha only works with smaller places. You need to record the name of the venue, its address, square footage, and maximum occupancy.

Bands
The bands that Samantha helps book venues are all young and hungry. This means that they can perform 1 or 2 acts every day. You must record the band name, number of members, musical genre, and the year they formed as a band.

Bookings
Samantha also wants to see a list at the bottom of the page that shows which band(s) are playing at each venue every night. She wants the band name, the venue name, and the date of the booking.

Example
"Rocket Pumpkins are playing at The Cellar Moss on 12/13/2023"

Layout
The layout is going to be similar to DeShawn's and Brewed Awakenings, but slightly different. Samantha wants to see the current bookings at the top of the page. Below the bookings, she wants to see a list of all available venues, and a list of all available bands, side by side. Venues on the left, and bands on the right.
